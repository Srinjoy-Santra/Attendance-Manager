The app aims to log in to the college sap portal and open up student attendance details regularly. Upon greater than minimum required attendance it will suggest to bunk some classes.

# Caution :
* The position of the various input fields changes irregularly, thus the positions are hardcoded. Before running the script find the appropriate positions using pyautogui.position()
function.
* The copy feature of pyautogui has some unresolved error due to which the script can't drag and copy paste. Feel free to suggest other ways of copying the attendance view.

# Current state :
 The app is logged in, student attendance details is accessed yet there is a problem in copying the data from the portal.

# Improvements needed :
* Periodic checking of the attendance
* Notifications regarding taking a leave
